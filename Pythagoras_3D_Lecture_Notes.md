# Pythagoras Theorem in 3D – Lecture Notes

---

## 1. Review of Pythagoras’ Theorem

In 2D, for a right triangle with legs a and b, and hypotenuse c:

\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

---

## 2. 3D Applications: Diagonals in 3D Shapes

In 3D space, we can extend Pythagoras’ Theorem to find the diagonal across a cuboid or space diagonal.

### 3D Diagonal Formula:

For a cuboid with dimensions \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \):

\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
\]

## 3. Calculating Surface Area and Volume of 3D Shapes

### Rectangular Prism:
- Volume: \( V = lwh \)
- Surface Area: \( SA = 2(lw + lh + wh) \)

### Cone:
- Volume: \( V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h \)
- Surface Area: \( SA = \pi r (r + l) \), where \( l \) is slant height

### Sphere:
- Volume: \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \)
- Surface Area: \( SA = 4\pi r^2 \)

### Cylinder:
- Volume: \( V = \pi r^2 h \)
- Surface Area: \( SA = 2\pi r(h + r) \)

## 4. Real-World Applications

- Construction and architecture: finding diagonal supports.
- Engineering: calculating distance between points in 3D space.
- Computer graphics and 3D modeling.

---

## Example Problem:

Find the diagonal of a box measuring 3 m long, 4 m wide, and 12 m high:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13\,\text{m}
\]

## Summary:

Pythagoras’ Theorem is a powerful tool extended into 3D to solve real-world spatial problems. Mastery of this concept supports geometry, physics, and design applications.
