# Vectors I â€“ Practice Exercises

---

## **1. Basic Vector Operations**

### Exercise 1:
Add the vectors:

$$
vec{a} = (3, 4), \quad vec{b} = (1, -2)
$$

### Exercise 2:
Subtract the vectors:

$$
vec{a} = (5, -1), \quad vec{b} = (2, 3)
$$

### Exercise 3:
Multiply vector $vec{v} = (2, -3)$ by scalar 4.

---

## **2. Magnitude and Direction**

### Exercise 4:
Find the magnitude of:

$$
vec{v} = (6, 8)
$$

### Exercise 5:
Find the direction (angle with the x-axis) of:

$$
vec{v} = (3, 3)
$$

---

## **3. Unit Vector and Vector Between Points**

### Exercise 6:
Find the unit vector in the direction of:

$$
vec{v} = (4, -3)
$$

### Exercise 7:
Find the vector from point A(2, 5) to B(7, 1).

---

## Challenge Question

### Exercise 8:

If $vec{a} = (x, 2)$ and $vec{b} = (3, y)$, find the values of x and y such that:

$$
vec{a} + vec{b} = (7, 5)
$$
