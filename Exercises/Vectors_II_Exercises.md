## **1. Dot Product**

### Exercise 1:
Find the dot product of:

$$
\vec{a} = (2, 3), \quad \vec{b} = (4, -1)
$$

### Exercise 2:
Determine if the vectors are perpendicular:

$$
\vec{a} = (1, 2), \quad \vec{b} = (-2, 1)
$$

## **2. Angle Between Vectors**

### Exercise 3:
Find the angle between:

$$
\vec{a} = (3, 4), \quad \vec{b} = (4, 3)
$$

## **3. Linear Dependence**

### Exercise 4:
Determine whether the vectors are linearly dependent:

$$
\vec{a} = (2, -1), \quad \vec{b} = (4, -2)
$$
