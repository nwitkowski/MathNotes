## 1. Vector Representation and Notation

A **vector** is a quantity that has both **magnitude** (length) and **direction**.

Vectors are usually denoted by boldface letters (e.g., **v**) or with an arrow on top (e.g., \( \vec{v} \)).

### Notation:
- In coordinate form: **v** = (x, y) in 2D or (x, y, z) in 3D.
- As a directed line segment from point A to B: $\vec{AB} = B - A$

## 2. Vector Addition, Subtraction, Scalar Multiplication

### Addition:
Add corresponding components:

$$
(3, 2) + (1, 4) = (4, 6)
$$

### Subtraction:
Subtract component-wise:

$$
(5, 3) - (2, 1) = (3, 2)
$$

### Scalar Multiplication:
Multiply each component by the scalar:

$$
2 · (3, -1) = (6, -2)
$$

## 3. Finding Magnitude and Direction

### Magnitude (Length) of vector **v** = (x, y):

$$
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

### Direction (Angle θ with positive x-axis):

$$
θ = \tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})
$$

## 4. Unit Vectors and Vector Between Two Points

### Unit Vector:
A vector with magnitude 1 in the same direction:

$$
\hat{v} = \frac{\vec{v}}{|\vec{v}|}
$$

### Vector Between Two Points A(x₁, y₁) and B(x₂, y₂):

$$
\vec{AB} = (x₂ - x₁, y₂ - y₁)
$$

## Summary:
- Vectors are fundamental for describing movement and forces in physics and engineering.
- They can be visualized as arrows in space and manipulated algebraically.
- Magnitude and direction are key to understanding a vector's effect.
