## 1. Frequency Tables and Class Intervals

**Frequency tables** organize data into groups or classes with corresponding frequencies.

### Example:

| Class Interval | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| 0 - 9          | 4         |
| 10 - 19        | 6         |
| 20 - 29        | 10        |

**Class midpoint** = average of the lower and upper bounds of the class.

---

## 2. Cumulative Frequency and Polygons

**Cumulative frequency** is the running total of frequencies.

### Cumulative Frequency Table:

| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 0 - 9          | 4         | 4                    |
| 10 - 19        | 6         | 10                   |
| 20 - 29        | 10        | 20                   |

**Cumulative frequency polygon** is a line graph connecting points at upper class boundaries and cumulative frequencies.

## 3. Measures of Central Tendency

### **Mean**:
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}
\]

Where:
- \( f \): frequency
- \( x \): midpoint of class

### **Median**:
- The middle value or average of two middle values when data is ordered.

### **Mode**:
- Most frequent value or class.

---

## 4. Range and Quartiles

### **Range**:
\[
\text{Range} = \text{Maximum} - \text{Minimum}
\]

### **Quartiles**:
- Divide data into four equal parts.
- Q1 = 25th percentile
- Q2 = median = 50th percentile
- Q3 = 75th percentile

### **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
\[
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
\]

---

## 5. Variance and Standard Deviation (Intro)

### Variance (\( \sigma^2 \)):
\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{n}
\]

### Standard Deviation (\( \sigma \)):
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
\]

- Measures the spread of data from the mean.

## Summary:

Understanding how to organize, summarize, and interpret data is key in statistics. Frequency tables and cumulative frequency provide foundational skills for graphical and numerical analysis.
