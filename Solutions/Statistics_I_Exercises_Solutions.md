## **1. Frequency Tables and Class Intervals**

### Solution 1:
Class intervals (width = 10):  
0–9: 1  
10–19: 2  
20–29: 2  
30–39: 2  
40–49: 2  
50–59: 1

---

## **2. Cumulative Frequency**

### Solution 2:

| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 0–9            | 1         | 1                    |
| 10–19          | 2         | 3                    |
| 20–29          | 2         | 5                    |
| 30–39          | 2         | 7                    |
| 40–49          | 2         | 9                    |
| 50–59          | 1         | 10                   |

## **3. Measures of Central Tendency**

### Solution 3:
Data: [2, 3, 5, 7, 3, 9, 3, 5, 6]  
Mean = (2+3+5+7+3+9+3+5+6)/9 = 43/9 ≈ 4.78  
Median = 5  
Mode = 3

---

## **4. Range and Quartiles**

### Solution 4:
Ordered: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]  
Range = 50 - 10 = 40  
Q1 = 20, Q2 = 30, Q3 = 40  
IQR = 40 - 20 = 20

---

## **5. Variance and Standard Deviation**

### Solution 5:
Mean = (4+8+6+5+3)/5 = 26/5 = 5.2  
Deviations: (-1.2)^2, (2.8)^2, (0.8)^2, (-0.2)^2, (-2.2)^2  
Variance = (1.44 + 7.84 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 4.84)/5 = 2.96  
SD = √2.96 ≈ 1.72

---

## Challenge Question

### Solution 6:
Estimated mean = (10*2 + 20*5 + 30*3) / (2 + 5 + 3) = (20 + 100 + 90)/10 = 210/10 = 21
