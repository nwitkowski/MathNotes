# Probability I – Solutions

---

## **1. Basic Probability**

### Solution 1:
Total balls = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10  
P(Red) = 3/10

### Solution 2:
Favorable outcomes: 1, 2, 3  
P(less than 4) = 3/6 = 1/2

---

## **2. Conditional Probability**

### Solution 3:
P(Basketball | Soccer) = P(Soccer ∩ Basketball) / P(Soccer)  
= 8 / 18 = 4/9

---

## **3. Tree Diagrams**

### Solution 4:
Outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT  
Favorable (at least one head): HH, HT, TH → 3 out of 4  
P(at least one head) = 3/4

## **4. Venn Diagrams and Set Operations**

### Solution 5:
Students who like only math = 22 - 10 = 12

---

## **5. Using Tables**

### Solution 6:

a) P(Female) = 20 / 40 = 1/2

b) P(Passed | Male) = 15 / 20 = 3/4

## Challenge Question

### Solution 7:
P(Tea ∪ Coffee) = P(Tea) + P(Coffee) - P(Both)  
= 0.7 + 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.9
