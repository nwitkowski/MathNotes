## **1. Box and Whisker Plots**

### Solution 1:
Data: [12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 34, 36, 40]  
a) Five-number summary:  
- Min: 12  
- Q1: 20  
- Median: 26.5  
- Q3: 34  
- Max: 40  

b) Plot shows a box from 20 to 34, median at 26.5, whiskers at 12 and 40.

## **2. Pie Charts and Bar Charts**

### Solution 2:
a) Pie chart angles:  
- Apples: (10/30)*360 = 120°  
- Bananas: (8/30)*360 = 96°  
- Oranges: (6/30)*360 = 72°  
- Grapes: (6/30)*360 = 72°  

b) Bar chart: 4 bars with heights proportional to counts.

## **3. Linear Transformation of Data**

### Solution 3:
Original: [2, 4, 6, 8]  
Transformed: [8, 14, 20, 26]  
New mean = (8 + 14 + 20 + 26)/4 = 68/4 = 17  
Original SD ≈ 2.58 → New SD = 3 * 2.58 ≈ 7.74

## **4. Data Analysis and Interpretation**

### Solution 4:
- Set A is tightly clustered around the mean.
- Set B is widely spread.

Set B has larger standard deviation due to wider spread.

## Challenge Question

### Solution 5:
a) IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 40 - 20 = 20  
b) 50% of the data lies between Q1 and Q3 in a box plot.
