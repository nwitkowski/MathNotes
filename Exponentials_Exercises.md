## **1. Basic Exponential Expressions**

### Exercise 1:
Simplify the expression:

$$
2^3 \cdot 2^4
$$

### Exercise 2:
Evaluate:

$$
(5^2)^3
$$

### Exercise 3:
Write as a single exponential:

$$
3^x \cdot 3^{2x}
$$

## **2. Exponential Growth and Decay**

### Exercise 4:
A population of 500 bacteria doubles every 3 hours. Write an exponential function to model this, and find the population after 9 hours.

### Exercise 5:
A car loses 20% of its value each year. If the original price is \$25,000, what is its value after 5 years?

## **3. Simple and Compound Interest**

### Exercise 6:
Calculate the amount after 4 years if \$1,000 is invested at a simple interest rate of 5% per annum.

### Exercise 7:
Calculate the amount if \$1,000 is invested at a compound interest rate of 5% per annum for 4 years, compounded annually.

## **4. Solving Exponential Equations**

### Exercise 8:
Solve for x:

$$
2^x = 16
$$

### Exercise 9:
Solve for x:

$$
3^{x+1} = 27
$$

### Exercise 10:
If a radioactive substance decays according to the equation:

$$
A(t) = 100 \cdot (0.5)^t
$$
Find the amount left after 6 hours.

## **Challenge Question**

### Exercise 11:
An investment grows according to:

$$
A = 500 \cdot (1.06)^t
$$
When will the investment reach \$1,000?
