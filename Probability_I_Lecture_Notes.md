## 1. Basic Probability

**Probability** measures how likely an event is to occur.

\[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
\]

- Probability ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

### Example:
- Rolling a 3 on a standard die:
  \[
  P(3) = \frac{1}{6}
  \]

## 2. Conditional Probability

The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

### Example:
- Drawing a red card given it is a heart.

## 3. Probability Laws

### **Addition Rule** (for mutually exclusive events):
\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
\]

### **Addition Rule (general)**:
\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\]

### **Multiplication Rule**:
- If A and B are independent:
  \[
  P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
  \]

## 4. Tree Diagrams

Tree diagrams are used to visualize and calculate the probability of combined events.

- Multiply along branches.
- Add outcomes at the end of paths if solving "or" probabilities.

### Example:
- Tossing a coin twice:
  - HH, HT, TH, TT

## 5. Venn Diagrams

Used to represent sets and relationships between events.

- **Union (A ∪ B)**: Either A or B or both
- **Intersection (A ∩ B)**: Both A and B
- **Complement (A′)**: Not A

Venn diagrams help visualize overlapping probabilities and apply formulas accurately.

## 6. Using Tables for Probability

Frequency tables can be used to calculate:
- Marginal probabilities (row/column totals)
- Joint probabilities (cell entries)
- Conditional probabilities (relative frequencies)

## Summary:

Probability is a powerful tool for analyzing chance events. Tree diagrams, Venn diagrams, and conditional probability are foundational techniques used in statistics and real-world analysis.
