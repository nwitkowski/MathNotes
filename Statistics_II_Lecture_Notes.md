## 1. Box and Whisker Plots

A **box and whisker plot** is a visual summary of data using five key values:
- Minimum
- First Quartile (Q1)
- Median (Q2)
- Third Quartile (Q3)
- Maximum

### Steps:
1. Order data.
2. Find quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3).
3. Draw box from Q1 to Q3, mark median.
4. Draw "whiskers" from box to min and max.

## 2. Pie Charts and Bar Charts

### Pie Charts:
- Represent data as sectors of a circle.
- Each sector's angle = $\frac{\text{frequency}}{\text{total}} \times 360^\circ$

### Bar Charts:
- Display data using bars of equal width.
- Height represents frequency or proportion.

## 3. Linear Transformation of Data

**Linear transformations** involve operations of the form:

$$
x' = ax + b
$$

Where:
- $a$ affects **spread** (scaling)
- $b$ shifts the **location** (translation)

### Effects:
- Mean: Transformed by $ax + b$
- Standard deviation: Affected only by $a$ (multiplied)

## 4. Data Analysis and Interpretation

- Compare **measures of central tendency** (mean, median, mode).
- Compare **spread** using range, IQR, and standard deviation.
- Use **graphs** (histograms, box plots) to visualize distribution and identify outliers or skewness.

## Summary:

Advanced statistical tools like box plots and transformations allow deeper insights into data behavior. Visualizations support comparison and interpretation across datasets and transformations.
